# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Video processing pipeline is now working end-to-end
- Frontend-backend integration is complete
- Real-time status updates and polling mechanism is implemented

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed frontend polling logic to continue until both transcript and summary are available
2. Added detailed logging throughout the application for better debugging
3. Updated response format in Node.js backend to match frontend expectations
4. Improved error handling and status reporting

## Active Decisions
- Using polling with 2-second intervals for status updates
- Maintaining separate transcript and summary tables in Supabase
- Using yt-dlp for more reliable YouTube video processing
- Implementing background processing for video analysis

## Next Steps
1. Add error handling for failed video processing
2. Implement retry mechanism for failed API calls
3. Add user feedback for processing status
4. Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time updates instead of polling

## Current Considerations
- Need to monitor performance of polling mechanism
- Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints
- May need to optimize database queries for better performance
- Should add more comprehensive error handling

## Development Environment
1. **Frontend**
   - Next.js development server
   - React Query DevTools
   - TypeScript compiler

2. **Backend**
   - Node.js development server
   - Python FastAPI server
   - Supabase local development

## Testing Focus
1. **Frontend**
   - Component testing
   - API integration testing
   - Error handling testing

2. **Backend**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Service integration testing
   - Error handling testing

## Documentation Needs
1. API documentation
2. Setup instructions
3. Development guidelines
4. Testing procedures

## Performance Considerations
1. Video processing time
2. API response times
3. Database query optimization
4. Frontend rendering performance
